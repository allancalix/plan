# Insert into yesterday's plan
! plan log "yesterday note" @~1
# Wait... the above is `plan log "..." @~1`... does it work?
# The global [DATE] is positional, maybe after flags?
# Let's test `plan @~1 show` directly:
! plan @~1 show
! plan show @~1
! plan @~1 log "also yesterday"
# And finally test precedence if both are passed (should probably error or just respect one)
# plan @~1 show @~2
